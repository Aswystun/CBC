# Week 6 Homework

This week, I will be using the tool [PARAS/PARASECT](https://paras.bioinformatics.nl/submit).
Usually, this tool can be used with the web browser (linked above), but this will be a protocol on how to install from source / use the tool via command line.
Everything will be installed and used on the [Alabama Supercomputer](https://asc.edu/).
