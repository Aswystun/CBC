# Downloading SRA
[You will need to install sra-toolkits](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki/02.-Installing-SRA-Toolkit)

Then download the data from [SRR25297534](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRR25297534) using:
```bash
fastq-dump SRR25297534
```
# Moving Data to SuperComputer Environment
This project will use the [Alabama Supercomputer](https://www.asc.edu/).
To push data to the supercomputer, use:
```bash
rsync --partial -arv <local path and file> <ID:remote path to target folder>
#For Example
rsync --partial -arv SRR25297534.fastq <username>@asax.asc.edu:<path>
```
# Trimming 

We utilize [This bash script](https://github.com/Aswystun/CBC/blob/main/Week2/trimmingCBC.sh) to trim low quality regions from the reads using [Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic).


```bash
#!/bin/bash

# loading required modules for script
module load trimmomatic/0.39
module load fastqc

# naming directories as variables for ease of use later on
# change paths as needed for project, using temporary scratch for storage purposes
RAWDATA=/home/aubscb001/CBC/RawData
CLEAN=$PBS_O_WORKDIR/CBC/CleanData
QC=$PBS_O_WORKDIR/CBC/PostCleanQC

# making the required directories if they do not already exist
mkdir -p $CLEAN
mkdir -p $QC

# progress checks on status of script running
echo "Starting trimming in $PBS_O_WORKDIR"
echo "RAWDATA dir: $RAWDATA"
echo "CLEAN dir:   $CLEAN"
echo "QC dir:      $QC"

# this file has the adaptors that will be looped over and trimmed in each of the SRR files
# the file was downloaded from GitHub

# loop through all R1 FASTQ files (works for .fastq and .fastq.gz) with safety checks. Parameters chosen based on general recommendations 
# from the trimmomatic manual
for R1 in $RAWDATA/*_1.fastq*; do
    # Skip if no files matched
    [ -e "$R1" ] || { echo "No input FASTQ files found in $RAWDATA"; exit 1; }

    # Infer R2 filename
    R2=${R1/_1.fastq/_2.fastq}
    base=$(basename "$R1" | sed 's/_1\.fastq.*//')

    echo "Processing sample: $base"
    echo "  R1: $R1"
    echo "  R2: $R2"

    trimmomatic PE -threads 8 -phred33 \
        "$R1" "$R2" \

done

# return that the script is completed
echo "âœ… Trimming + QC finished. Results in:"
echo "   $CLEAN"
echo "   $QC"
```

The output for this script are trimmed [R1](https://github.com/Aswystun/CBC/blob/main/Week2/SRR25297534_1_paired_fastqc.zip) and [R2](https://github.com/Aswystun/CBC/blob/main/Week2/SRR25297534_2_paired_fastqc.zip) paired reads.
