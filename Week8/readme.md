# Week 8 Homework

### The main goal of this repository is to Utilize *RecipeNLG* by [Michał Bień et al](https://aclanthology.org/2020.inlg-1.4/) to form a novel anlysis of the large curated dataset. 


First we need to [download](https://recipenlg.cs.put.poznan.pl/) the curated .csv

Then, as per the author's recommendation, we filter and subset the data based on source=Gathered.
