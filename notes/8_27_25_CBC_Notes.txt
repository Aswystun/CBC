Ti/Tv fundamental ratio across all genomic analyses. 

Transition/Transversion (Ti/Tv) Ratio:
This ratio is a metric used in genetic studies to assess the quality of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and to understand DNA sequence evolution.
What it measures:
It compares the frequency of transitions (substitutions between purines or pyrimidines, e.g., A to G or C to T) and transversions (substitutions between a purine and a pyrimidine, e.g., A to C or T to G).
Significance:
The ratio is used for quality control in high-throughput sequencing data, as it is known to be influenced by factors like genome regions and DNA content.



mapping can also take care of trimming, trim b=vs untrimmed, map it, see if there is a difference (there shouldn't be, but there might be.)

BWA (Burrows-Wheeler Aligner) is a software tool for aligning short DNA sequencing reads (like those from Illumina) to a large reference genome


fastp
A tool designed to provide ultrafast all-in-one preprocessing and quality control for FastQ data.


Kraken is an ultrafast and highly accurate program for assigning taxonomic labels to metagenomic DNA sequences. 



Homework for week 2 --> week 3

journal club format for next week. 
All pick our own paper for next week, a methodology paper, not focusing on the biology / hypothesis. 
Newer papers (Maybe the new Nadine Ziemert paper. I would probably be the only one who knows about it.)
